![Sunjay Varma](/assets/images/me.png){: .right} My name is Sunjay Varma. I am a
highly experienced software developer who has been writing code for over a
decade. My skills have been refined by over 3 years of professional experience.
I have designed entire systems of software, led developers to implement them,
and worked with others to improve the systems as they grew.

I actively contribute to open source and explore a number of different areas in
my personal projects. As a result, I have written a [compiler][brain], [a fast
interpreter][brainfuck] for a small language, and even [an image editor][rhino].
Besides those projects, I have also created a [library to help teach beginners
how to code][turtle] in Rust, contributed to other libraries, and provided new
features and bug fixes for tools I use in my own development. Most recently, I
also started contributing code to the [Rust compiler][rustc]. See my [GitHub]
profile for more on my projects and contributions.

One way I share programming with people is by teaching it to as many people as I
can. Over the last decade since I started programming, I have written many
online tutorials and in depth blog posts. Not only does this help me deepen my
own knowledge, it also allows me to share what I learn with other people. You
can often find me in online forums or StackOverflow helping people learn
programming and find solutions to their problems.

![Many languages](/assets/images/languages.png){: .left} I have explored many
different programming languages including Rust, Python, JavaScript, Haskell, C,
C++ and more. Learning so many programming languages has taught me many
different paradigms and programming techniques. I find that there is a lot I can
learn by considering a variety of sources and methodologies.
