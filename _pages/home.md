![Sunjay Varma](/assets/images/me.png){: .right} My name is Sunjay Varma. I am a
highly experienced software developer and future software engineer currently
studying at the University of Waterloo.

What sets me apart from other software developers is my breadth of software
development experience, ability to quickly pick up on *any* new technology and
the little details I see that other developers may not.

I love solving interesting problems and tackling them using software.

There are lots of detail oriented people out there, but I take it to another
level entirely. I use the skills I have developed to find the details that
matter the most.

I know I can pick up *any* technology very quickly because I do it all the time.
I learn new programming languages for fun and pick up new frameworks on the go
at work and on my own as well.

I have been writing software for over 9 years. It is my favorite thing to do
because I can build anything with software. From small interfaces to entire
universes, I can make it all.

Let's build something amazing.
