I am a skilled software developer with experience in a number of different areas
including compilers, web development, game development, and much more. As an
avid contributor to open source, I have spent much of my career creating free
software and free online learning resources. In my spare time, I enjoy reading
about interesting programming topics, watching comedy, playing board games, and
hacking on projects online.
