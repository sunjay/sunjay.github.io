This is the source code for my personal website.

If you find an issue with a page on my website or one of my posts, please
open a [new GitHub issue][issues].

This is currently a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. This is convenient
because all of my projects automatically get their own directories on my domain
name. For example, the `snake` project `gh-pages` branch can be seen at
`http://sunjay.dev/snake`.

## Setup

Use this guide: https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/

Install ruby dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

Run server:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
