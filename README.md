# sunjay.github.io

This is the source code for my personal website.

This is currently a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. This is convenient
because all of my projects automatically get their own directories on my domain
name. For example, the `snake` project `gh-pages` branch can be seen at
`http://sunjay.dev/snake`.
